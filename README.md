# VeeHarmGen 3.0.0
VeeHarmGen adds chords to a melody using various pop, jazz and classical chord style files. It is a **Ve**rtical **Harm**ony **Gen**eration program that 
takes an **input** musicxml file containing a **melody** and placeholder chord symbols (temporary chords that give a harmonic rhythm) and
creates **output** musicxml files with more elaborate or (hopefully) fitting **Chord Symbols**.
These can be played back and edited in scorewriter programs
such as MuseScore 3.6.2.

## Changes

- v3.0.0 2024. Add more chord styles, style evaluation in Introduction and a chord_choice of nth_outcome away from the most popular chord outcome.
- v2.0.0 2023. Add chord styles and a chord_choice of rank which uses a nearest-rank ordered list of possible chords.
- v1.0.0 2022. Initial version uses key analysis on input music melody slices to produce chords.

## QuickStart

Assuming you have:
- the pre-requisites (MuseScore, Python, and Music21)
- performed the VeeHarmGen install for your platform
- a music.mxl file in the input/music directory with a single stave monophonic melody, e.g.

![e.g. Music](assets/images/music.png)

### Windows
Start cmd

    cd <install folder>
    run music

Start explorer, goto the output folder under VeeHarmGen, double click on a .mxl file to view in MuseScore.

### macOS / Ubuntu
Start a terminal

    cd ~/VeeHarmGen
    chmod a+x *.sh
    
    ./run.sh music

Use finder / file manager to goto the output directory under VeeHarmGen, double click on a .mxl file to view in MuseScore.

e.g. this uses **tune slice key analysis** to add chords:

![e.g. Music](assets/images/music-BAR1.png)

e.g. this uses the **all_jazz chord style** to add chords:

## Introduction

VeeHarmGen is a Vertical Harmony Generation program that 
takes an input musicxml file containing a melody and 
creates output musicxml files with added Chord Symbols.

VeeHarmGen expects two types of input files : 

- tunes **without sections** where the generated harmonic rhythm (beats or bars per chord ) will be continous throughout the song.
For example music with a generated 2 bar harmonic rhythm:

![e.g. Music](assets/images/music-BAR2.png)

- tunes **with sections** (from MarkMelGen https://github.com/RedFerret61/MarkMelGen ) where the generated harmonic rhythm will restart on each section (denoted by staff text to identify the section start point: 
                intro, verse, prechorus, chorus, solo, bridge or outro). For example 
the previous section to the PRECHORUS ends with a 1 bar chord, and the PRECHORUS restarts the 2 bar chord rhythm.

![e.g. Cairo-BAR2-folk_1-R100](assets/images/Cairo-BAR2-folk_1-R100.png)


VeeHarmGen version 1 used the **tune slice key analysis** feature in Music21 to add chords. 
(see https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/usersGuide/usersGuide_15_key.html ).
However instead of analysing the whole piece, the tune is sliced into differently sized windows of analysis to get the key every quarter note, 
every half note, every measure, every two measures, etc.  Each key becomes a chord for the slice e.g. C or Am,
This works when there are severel different pitches in the tune slice.
When there is only one note in a slice, the result is ambiguous e.g. the key/chord may be Em or E. 
The the key analysis method of chord selection is selected with the -d DEMO option to demonstrate some different 
commonly used chords and harmonic rhythms.

VeeHarmGen version 2 introduced preset **chord styles** of a map of the pitch classes to chords. 
By default output is generated for all styles.
The -s STYLE option can be used to filter the generated output e.g. -s jazz only includes style names containing the string jazz.
See VeeHarmGen/input/style for the set of styles and "all" superset styles.

VeeHarmGen version 3 added more chord styles (Classical, Film and Game), a style evaluation (see below)
 and a chord_choice of nth_outcome away from the most popular chord outcome and a run_out script to use it e.g.
    
    run_out
       USAGE: run_out n style instrument mxlfile
       where n is the last outcome (outcomes start at 0)
             style is a style filter string on files in input/style directory
             instrument is used by the output melody (chords are Piano), for instruments, see python VeeHarmGen.py -h
             mxlfile has placeholder chords and includes path
       Output for chord outcomes is in written to the output directory
       Examples:
       run_out 1 _pop_ Harmonica input/music/placeholder_chords/Cairo-PC.mxl
	   run_out 2 pop_country_1 Violin input/music/placeholder_chords/Cairo-PC.mxl
       run_out 3 all_contemporary Piano input/music/placeholder_chords/Cairo-PC.mxl

Each slice of melody has a set of pitch classes which can be mapped to a chord in a particular style.

There are 12 pitch classes in standard Western music: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A# and B. 
The pitch class C consists of the Cs in all octaves. In VeeHarmGen ptc.json files a 12-bit pattern, 
e.g. **"1000 1001 0000", represents a melody containing the pitch classes C, E and G.**  
The first bit is C, the second is C#, ..., the last bit is B.

For example, an excerpt from all-_-ptc.json:

       "1000 1001 0000": {
        "C": 30,
        "G": 3,
        "B-": 1,
        "D7": 1,
        "G9": 3,
        "Em7": 1,
        "Fmaj7": 1,
        "F#maj7": 1,
        "C6": 1,
        "A7": 6,
        "Am7": 1,
        "Am": 1,
        "Cm": 1,
        "C/E": 1
    },
	


In the above example, there is a "tune" slice with only C, E and G notes, 
where the (unsorted) chord frequencies for the "tune" included:

       30 "C" chords
       6 "A7" chords 
       3 "G" chords
       3 "G9" chords
      etc.  
   
If VeeHarmGen was given an input tune slice with only C, E and G notes, it would select the "C" chord by default,  
unless the rank command line option was supplied, where 1 is least frequent and 100 (the default) is the most frequent
in the nearest-rank ordered list of possible chords.

### Example VeeHarmGen workflow 1

- Generate harmonic rhythms
  - Choose desired harmonic rhythm e.g. BAR1 (optionally manually edit to vary the rhythm. 
  In MuseScore, to create a Chord Symbol: select start note and then use the menu option Add > Text > Chord Symbol 
  (shortcut Ctrl+K))  
- Run desired harmonic rhythm for all styles
  - Choose favourite style e.g. glam_rock_1 
- Run chosen style with a variety of chord ranks e.g. 60, 30, 1 on various instruments (for a list of instruments: python VeeHarmGen.py -h)
  - Choose favourite chord rank

Assuming Perambulate.mxl is in VeeHarmGen\input\music:

Windows commands

    python VeeHarmGen.py -m input/music/Perambulate.mxl
    python VeeHarmGen.py -m output/Perambulate-BAR1.mxl
    python VeeHarmGen.py -m output/Perambulate-BAR1.mxl -s glam_rock_1 -c rank -n 60 -i Saxophone
    python VeeHarmGen.py -m output/Perambulate-BAR1.mxl -s glam_rock_1 -c rank -n 30 -i "Reed Organ" 
    python VeeHarmGen.py -m output/Perambulate-BAR1.mxl -s glam_rock_1 -c rank -n 1 -i Celesta
 
macOS / Ubuntu commands 

    python3 VeeHarmGen.py -m input/music/Perambulate.mxl
    python3 VeeHarmGen.py -m output/Perambulate-BAR1.mxl
    python3 VeeHarmGen.py -m output/Perambulate-BAR1.mxl -s glam_rock_1 -c rank -n 60 -i Saxophone
    python3 VeeHarmGen.py -m output/Perambulate-BAR1.mxl -s glam_rock_1 -c rank -n 30 -i "Reed Organ"
    python3 VeeHarmGen.py -m output/Perambulate-BAR1.mxl -s glam_rock_1 -c rank -n 1 -i Celesta

### Example VeeHarmGen workflow 2

- Generate harmonic rhythms from an input melody file with no with placeholder chords.
  - Choose best harmonic rhythm e.g. BEAT1, BEAT2 or BAR1 
- Optionally manually edit generated chosen file to vary the harmonic rhythm. 
It may be helpful to open all the preferred harmonic rhythm files 
and copy and paste chord harmonic rhythms to the best one. 
Note: the chord names do not matter as they will be replaced later. 
  - In MuseScore:
	- to delete a chord symbol, select it and press the Delete key
	- to create a Chord Symbol: select start note and then use the menu option Add > Text > Chord Symbol 
  (shortcut Ctrl+K))  
	- To copy a harmonic rhythm, in source file, select first Chord Symbol, shift+click last chord symbol, Ctrl+C to copy.
In target file, delete any existing chords in the target bars, select first note in target bars, Ctrl+V to paste. 	
- Run desired harmonic rhythm for first 10 chord outcomes in desired style(s) e.g. country_rock_2 
- Choose favourite chord outcome

Assuming Cairo.mxl is in VeeHarmGen\input\music and Cairo-PC.mxl is created in VeeHarmGen\input\music\placeholder_chords:

Windows commands:

	wf2_no_pc Cairo
	
	"C:\Program Files\MuseScore 3\bin\MuseScore3.exe"
		- File > Open ... e.g. ...\VeeHarmGen\output\Cairo-BEAT1.mxl and BEAT2 and BAR1
		- when finished editing best file,
		- File > Export > MusicXML, Export ...,  ...\VeeHarmGen\input\music\placeholder_chords\Cairo-PC.mxl
		
	wf2_nth_outcome input/music/placeholder_chords/Cairo-PC.mxl country_rock_2

 
macOS / Ubuntu commands 

    ./wf2_no_pc.sh Cairo
	
	In Finder navigate to VeeHarmGen/output and open desired file with MuseScore
    e.g. ...\VeeHarmGen\output\Cairo-BEAT1.mxl and BEAT2 and BAR1
		- when finished editing best file,
		- File > Export > MusicXML, Export ...,  ...\VeeHarmGen\input\music\placeholder_chords\Cairo-PC.mxl
		
    ./wf2_nth_outcome.sh input/music/placeholder_chords/Cairo-PC.mxl country_rock_2

### Example VeeHarmGen workflow 3

- Manually add harmonic rhythm chords (e.g. C)  to an input melody file, for example
  - open input\music\placeholder_chords\Cairo-PC.mxl with MuseScore
  - In MuseScore to create a Chord Symbol: select start note and then use the menu option Add > Text > Chord Symbol 
  (shortcut Ctrl+K)), to delete a chord symbol, select it and press the Delete key  
  - Choose favourite style(s) e.g. _pop_ 
- Run a number of chord outcomes in a chosen style(s) and instrument on an input file.

Windows:

	run_out 1 _pop_ Harmonica input/music/placeholder_chords/Cairo-PC.mxl
	
 
macOS / Ubuntu: 

    ./run_out.sh 1 _pop_ Harmonica input/music/placeholder_chords/Cairo-PC.mxl

- Audition output chords in output directory in MuseScore
	  

### Evaluating VeeHarmGen output against manual harmonisation

There are different ways to harmonise a melody, depending on the style and genre of music. Some common methods are:

- Using primary chords: 
	- These are the chords built on the first, fourth, and fifth degrees of the scale, also known as the I, IV, and V chords. 
	They are the most basic and common chords in any key, and they can harmonise any melody note in that key. 
	- For example, in the key of C major, the primary chords are Cmaj, Fmaj, and Gmaj. To harmonise a melody in C major, you can use these three chords and find one that has a note in common with each melody note. 
- Using secondary chords: 
	- These are the chords built on the other degrees of the scale, such as the II, III, VI, and VII chords. They are also called diatonic chords, because they are derived from the same scale as the melody. They can add more variety and colour to the harmony, especially when used with primary chords. 
	- For example, in the key of C major, the secondary chords are Dmin, Emin, Amin, and Bdim. To harmonise a melody in C major, you can use these chords along with the primary chords and find one that has a note in common with each melody note. 
- Using non-diatonic chords: 
	- These are chords that do not belong to the same scale as the melody, but they can still create interesting and unexpected harmonies. They are also called chromatic chords, because they introduce notes that are outside of the scale. They can be borrowed from other keys or modes, or they can be altered or extended versions of diatonic chords. 
	- For example, in the key of C major, some non-diatonic chords are Cmin, F#maj, G7b9, or Amaj7. To harmonise a melody in C major, you can use these chords along with the diatonic chords and find one that has a note in common with each melody note. However, you have to be careful not to clash with the melody or create too much dissonance.

### Chord evaluation advice

The chord tones are the root 1, 3, 5, and 7th chords. 

The 2, 4, and 6 notes are called tensions. Tensions are non chord tones that can be used for embellishment. 
They sound best in the mid to high ranges. They should be used with caution and tested to avoid conflict in a chord structure. 
Sometimes a 6th tone is used instead of the 7th tone for a smoother sound.

The 7th tone of the scale works with the 3rd tone to bring out more of the chords character. 
The combination of the 3rd and 7th tones are called guide tones. 

### Cadence evaluation advice
There are three cadences, the Tonic, Subdominant and the Dominant.

Tonic cadences are used for stability and rest.

Subdominant cadences are used for motion but should resolve into a stronger chord (a dominant or a tonic).

Dominant chords can stand on their own and they sound great when resolving into tonic chords.

One of the very useful and powerful aspects of cadences is that chords of like cadences in the same key can be substituted for each other.
The I, III, and VI chords are tonic chords the can be substitutes for each other, The II,IV, and *VII chords can be substituted for each other.

The V and VII chords can be substututes for each other. The *VII (b-7b5 chord) has a dual function.
It can act as a subdominant chord when moving into a dominant chord. It can act as a dominant chord when moving a tonic chord.
Experiment with cadences in your chord progressions.



### MuseScore Track/Chord Volume
- View > Mixer (F10)
- At top of desired channel (with chords) click right arrow to show channels
- Expect display of 2 channels: normal and Chord syms.
- You can now adjust volume of the main track and chord symbols separately.


### Play output with Metronome
 If using MuseScore, you can add a metronome by
 View > Play Panel (F11 toggle) and  by Metronome, click the right icon for play metronome.

If output is corrupted in MuseScore 3.6.2, alternatively check the output in other score writing software e.g.
- https://my.avid.com/get/sibelius-first 

## ToolsForStyleCreation

To create your own input style files you need several musicxml (.mxl) files. 
Each file must contain a leadsheet melody with chord symbols above the staff. 


- "create_chord_map.py" analyses one song to create chord data files 
- Manually create a new style name directory and populate with chord data files from several songs
- "create_styles.py" merges the chord data from several songs to create one style

### Converting an input musicxml (.mxl) or midi (.mid) file with melody and chord parts to a leadsheet with melody with chord symbols for create_chord_map.py

The instructions assume you have MuseScore 3.6.2.
	
If you have a midi or musicxml file of the desired song with separate melody and chordal accompaniment parts:
- Open the .mid file with MuseScore
- View > Mixer F10 
- Start Playback
- In Mixer toggle "S" to solo each track to determine the name of the melody instrument e.g. trumpet, and best chordal instrument e.g. piano

If the chord part does not have chord symbols then you can automatically add chord symbols 
	using musescore plugin: 
https://musescore.org/en/project/chord-identifier-pop-jazz 

- Open midi (.mid) or music xml (.mxl) file in musescore.
- Copy the melody to a new file:
	- On the melody part, click first bar, hold "Page Dn" to end, shift click last bar, Ctrl+C to copy
	- if the file has a key signature note the number of sharps or flats e.g. 5 sharps
	- File > New , Next, Solo > Guitar, Next, select Key Signature, e.g. 5 sharps, Finish
	- Ctrl-V to paste
- Click on original midi tab in MuseScore
	- Delete non-chordal parts from file to leave a (mainly) chordal part e.g. organ or piano :
		- Edit > Instruments. For each non-chordal part e.g. bass, drums, melody, (occasional) strings, arpegiated guitar
		- Select non-chordal part 
		- Click "Remove from Score"
	- On remaining chord part, click Plugins > Chords > Chord Identifier (Pop_Jazz) 
	- eg Symbol:Normal, Bass:Yes, Inversion:No, Highlight:No, Incomplete:Show ?? Entire Note:Yes. OK.
	- File > Export, Musicxml, Compressed, Export ... <song>-Chords.mxl
- Copy Chords to new melody file (one at a time, as defect copying all together makes stacatto chords, not duration to next chord)	
	- For each Chord Symbol in original midi tab
		- Select Chord symbol, Ctrl-C to copy
		- Select new melody file tab, click on matching melody note, Ctrl-V to paste Chord
	- if you want to add a song section, e.g. PRECHORUS 1 ,  Add > Text > Stave Text (Ctrl+T)
- When finished adding chord symbols to melody, save melody file:
	- File > Export, Musicxml, Compressed, Export ... <song>-Melody-Chords.mxl
	

Alternatively see if the chords are available in chordify e.g.
- https://chordify.net/ log in, search for the song, click on the one with the most "jam sessions" that is CHORDIFIED. 
  Click  Overview, Save to Setlist.
  (F11 full screen, screenshot, save). 
- If meter wrong then click Edit e.g. change Meter from 4/4 to 3/4. However bar lines may still not match exactly e.g. 1 Musescore  bar may equal 2 chordify bars. 
- If chordify bar lines on wrong beat then click on the arrow buttons next to 'shift chords':
- For each chord: 
    - click on a square a couple of bars before chord 
	- play (allow chordiy and YouTube to synchronise) 
	- remember the melody note the chord sounds on
	- enter chord on note of melody instrument stave in MuseScore
        - Click on notes in other parts to check the note pitch (view > Status Bar) 
		at the bottom fits the chordify chord
		- Select a start note or rest; Press Ctrl + K (Mac: Cmd + K )
        - Enter chord symbol e.g. Am7. Exit chord symbol mode by pressing Esc, or click away
        - If you want to edit a chord symbol double click on it
		- If the melody does not have a note on the desired beat then edit it to have a rest or note on that beat. e.g. 
		    - View > Toolbars > Note Input selected 
			- Note input mode selected (N)
			- on toolbar select quarter note, and select rest or note (as appropriate)
		    - on melody select a whole bar rest
		    - it is converted to quarter note rests or notes
			- press Esc

or search Utlimate Guitar for Chords e.g. https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/search.php?title=The+Entertainer&page=1&type=300

- If key wrong then in MuseScore transpose to desired key, e.g. 
	- for C / Am, Ctrl+A, Tools Transpose Chromatically, To Key, Closest, C Major/A minor, Options, select transpose chord symbols, use single # and b only.
	- or other key such as up a fifth: Ctrl+A, Tools Transpose Chromatically, By Interval, Up, Perfect Fifth deselect transpose key signatures )

When finished entering chords, reduce score to melody tracks 
There may be more than one melody track, one file for each. 
A melody track should not contain long passages of repeated notes, e.g. in a string quartet, melody tracks could be violin 1 and violin 2, probably not viola or cello.
If there is more than one melody track, copy chords to each track and save.
For each melody track, open the master file: 

- Edit > Instruments (I)
- Select each stave, if not the melody stave click "Remove from score", then click OK
- Rewind to start, Start Playback. Check only melody remains.
- Ensure all parts are in Concert Pitch. e.g. Change instrument set-up e.g. Sax to Piano or Voice, 
    - ^A (select all), Right-click on an empty part of the measure and choose Stave/Part Properties... · 
    - Click on Change Instrument. e.g. Piano , OK.  
    - If it was a wind instrument e.g. sax then copy and paste into a non transposing track e.g. voice , or 
    - Tools Transpose Chromatically, By Interval, Up, Minor Sixth, deselect transpose key signatures.
	- or in Toolbar area, select Concert Pitch, which displays score in written or concert (sounding) pitch.
- File > Export, Musicxml, Export ...
- Choose directory e.g. VeeHarmGen\input\music\placeholder_chords\stylename or VeeHarmGen\private\input\music\placeholder_chords\stylename
- Rename e.g. Song_Title-Chords

Tips for MuseScore 3:
- Remove a range of measures: Select a range of measures;
  Press Ctrl+Del (Mac: Cmd+Del).
- Remove a note or rest: Select 
  Press Ctrl+Del (Mac: Cmd+Del).
  Note: ripple edit is not available in MuseScore. If you need ripple edit then try Cakewalk.
- Save the changes (File > Export, Musicxml, Compressed, Export ...)
- To reduce a polyphonic stave to monophonic:
    - Edit > Instuments, Keyboards, Piano,  Add to score,
	- Select polyphonic line containing melody (click first note, shift click last note)
	- Tools > Explode
    - Edit > Instuments, for each non melody instrument,
		- select Instrument, Remove from Score	

### Creating style chord data from song lead sheets in musicxml format

There is an example scripts to show how to create style chord data for VeeHarmGen on windows.

    create_example_style_1.cmd

This uses create_chord_map.py and create_styles.py.

The "create_chord_map.py" tool can analyse mxl files in a directory to create chord data files (.json) representing the chords for that file.
By default the output is placed in the input/style directory.

Normal run inputs specified song file and outputs to input/style:

Note: ensure input filename does not contain spaces.

    create_chord_map.py -m private/input/music/placeholder_chords/classical_classical_2/ -o private/input/style/classical_classical_2/


Now check the chord data file, e.g. XXX-_-ptc.json, contains the expected chords from 
input\music\placeholder_chords\XXX_normalised.mxl

Note:
- Double slash chords are ignored e.g. replace C/g/G with C/G 

If not, the input file may be corrupted and need recreating, or input chords may need manually correcting.

Note: although the song may appear to be incorrectly normalised, later VeeHarmGen.py will transpose the input tune similarly so the chords should match.

### Creating styles

Create a new style name directory e.g. traditional-1 in input/style.  

Move the desired individual (.json) chord data files to this directory e.g. traditional-1. 

Run create_styles.py which for each sub-directory in input/styles  
merges the .json files in the sub-directory and writes 
the style data in parent including the name of sub-directory in the output file name.
e.g. traditional-1-_-ptc.json
Note: aim to get an output file of at least 4k in size.

Normal run (which looks for populated style directories under input/styles) :

    create_styles.py

Run specifying a different directory (note: afterwards, you will need to 
manually copy .json files to input/styles ) :

    create_styles.py -i private/input/style

### Known Problems
- Remove all Grace notes from input mxl or VeeHarmGen.py will fail with:  
ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero
